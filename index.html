     <h1>Jambo!</h1>
     <h2>I'm Ivy Nzioka, a freelance<br>developer and designer.</h2>
     <p>I've always been drawn to the overlap between design and development.<br>My skills are broad from ux to design, front end to back end development.<br>I strive to build immersive and beautiful web applications through carefully<br>crafted code and user-centric design.
       <br>Since graduating with a B.S. in Computer Science from MIT University in 2007, <br>I have focused my professional career almost exclusively on front-end development.<br>

       When not online, I can be found in Nairobi,Kenya with my family,searching for<br>the perfect vintage items for my home, trying out a new recipe<br>in the kitchen, experimenting in gardening, or snuggling with my two dogs, Zuma and Moran .</p>
